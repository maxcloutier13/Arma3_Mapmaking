Tools for Armed Assault/ArmA 2, 07.07.2010

Based largely on file format information from BIS wiki, thanks
to everyone who contributed on those.

cpbo:
Extracts and creates PBO files. Run from windows explorer to
associate it with directories and PBO files, after which you
can extract PBO files by double clicking, and create PBO files
by right clicking a directory. Also can be used from console.
The PBO path prefix is saved to and read from a special file
called $PBOPREFIX$ in the directory.

unRap:
"Decodes" raP encoded files, such as config.bin and rvmat files.
Run the exe from windows explorer and select the file(s) you want
to decode, or use from console.
unRap overwrites all files it needs without asking, so be
careful when working with original game files.

PAAplug:
Experimental PAA format plugin for Adobe Photoshop.

UE_highlight:
SQS/SQF syntax highlighting for UltraEdit.

Notes:
cpbo creates its shell integration using the following
registry keys:
 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.pbo\DefaultIcon
 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.pbo\shell\Extract all
 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.pbo\shell\Extract PBO...
 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Folder\shell\create PBO\
you can remove these keys with regedit to remove the explorer
integration
